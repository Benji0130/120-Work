##Homework
This weeks lesson I felt was a bit more clear. This week we worked with OOP's, which are objects that have attributes describing them, and its functions or methods of ways they can act within the coded sketch.
##Problems
This week I ran into my code not wanting to function. I found out that I was missing a simple bracket, which was causing my code to error.
