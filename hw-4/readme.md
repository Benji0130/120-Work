## Weekly Readme
This week we focused on the p5 HTML codes, with that we learned how to create different shapes and color them. During the course we also learned how to manipulate them and then created a portrait using what we learned. Steps I took to complete this homework was inferring with my study group and working on the assignment together, also taking notes helped but I think just more practice will do because this is difficult and I have a difficult time. I haven't helped any others because I'm having a hard time myself trying to understand this material.
