## Homework
Learned animation in p5
Pulled from other lessons to animate objects and characters.


## Difficulties
I had a hard time understanding the lesson without the example. Trying to get everything perfect also is a pain. I sat here going over my code and even re-typed it all to find out that I had misspelled something that threw it all off. This week I followed the example given on the creepy head guy to understand the functions we are learning in p5. Going through the example and following the outline helped me get a better understanding in animation techniques.
