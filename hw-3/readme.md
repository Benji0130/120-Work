## p5 Hello World!
["Hello World!" Sketch](https://benji0130.github.io/120-Work/hw-3/)

## Homework Experience
In this homework cycle we learned about the p5 function and how to use it to create sketch's and text, then upload it to the internet for all to see. For me I followed the directions to the 'T'. It's the safest way to accomplish this course I think. To complete this assignment I watched the videos and slowly went through the examples with my friend Trason who also is in the class. (You met us earlier, when we needed your guidance.) When we started in the the color background everything went smooth until it wouldn't upload. I couldn't figure out why until Trason spotted a spelling error I made, after that everything went dapper and smooth. Well as I am typing this, I am also trying to help Trason figure out why his GitHub desktop refuses to upload to his repository.
N/A I have no questions over any of the material right now.
