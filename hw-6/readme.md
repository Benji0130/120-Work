## Homework Week 6
This week we learned how to map variables and data types using math. Using these techniques we were able to create a picture that would move around the canvas or present itself wherever on the canvas. This weeks picture I did a little drawing of myself screaming at this assignment, I am one of those who battles with math, so this assignment was a little tricky. For the assignment I stuck closely to the examples given, I wanted to make sure that what I created would work. I worked with my buddy in a group as well to try and understand the concepts a little better, and help one another out if needed.
