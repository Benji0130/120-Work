This week we learned about 'for' and 'while' loops. These loops allow the coder to tell the computer to run a series of statements within a function block, "x" amount of times, this allows the coder to bypass writing thousands of lines of code. This weeks assignment I chose to keep it simple and have my code loop ellipses at random, it reminded me of those old computers that would take up entire rooms with its lights flashing as it analyzed some code, at least thats what it reminded me of.
I still struggle to grasp everything thrown at us to be completely honest, but the videos and examples given have helped out a lot in grasping what the code should be doing.
