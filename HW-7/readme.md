# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing


  Line four is the width of the ellipse being made.
  Lines five and six dictate the starting position of the ellipse made on either the x or y axis.
  Lines seven through 10 dictate the change and how far each movement of the ellipse goes through the x and y axis.
  Lines 12-14 describe the size of the canvas we will be working with, along with its background color if we choose so.
  Within the function code in lines 21 and 22, the code is set up to multiply by itself so it can move forward. The 'if' statements within lines 25-29 constrain the ball within the canvas so it can have its 'bouncing' effect.
  Within the 'mousePressed' function, lines 37-38 allow the user to alter the original path preset in the code. The user can change the speed and path of the ball by simple mouse clicks.
  Each code starts and ends with a curly bracket ({}).



## How did you alter the sketch?


In the sketch, I changed the color and size of the ellipse moving through the canvas. I also changed the trajectory in which it would take, also at first the background color is just a plain white but using the mouseIsPressed function, I was able to randomize the background in which the ball traveled on for each click, giving the viewer a new environment. A click anywhere on the canvas will also present a new pattern the ellipse creates.
