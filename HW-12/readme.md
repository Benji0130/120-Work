## Homework
This week we had arrays interact in loops. Doing this made it so the objects would interact with each other.

## Difficulties
No lie, this week was a bit more difficult for me to keep up on. I was a bit confused and tried to mimic an example and couldn't even get it to work properly. My code says that nothing is wrong but my objects are staying in one place :/
